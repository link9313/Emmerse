        <h1>What is the Emmerse?</h1>
        <p>The Emmerse is a new way of viewing concerts and sports.
        You can immerse yourself in the environment to accurately
        portray that you are there. You nolonger have to wish you could see
		and event as if you were there. You can actually be "there" and enjoy
		the environment and the event as if you were there.

		<section id="How" class="information">
		<h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
		<p>The Emmerse is an app that uses the technology of the Oculus Rift
		so the user can virtually be where they wish to be. The Oculus Rift provides the virtual
		environment that makes the user feel as if they are watching the concert in person
		or are personally at the football game. Instead of only being able to watch the game
		on TV, people can now freely feel the same experience as if you were at the game.
