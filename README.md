# Emmerse

Emmerse allows you to virtually experience various forms of entertainment in
180-degrees. These include: concerts, sporting events, and gaming events.

This is done through the Oculus Rift VR D2 headset.
The program is written in unity to support Mac OS X and Windows platforms.

The program currently is able to access a webcam for live video and 3 360-degree videos. These videos
are each from an aspect of the project: 2 contrasting music selections (one classical and one metal) and
a sports sample (race car driving).

This project was made for ITIN 2220 Applied Innovation at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
