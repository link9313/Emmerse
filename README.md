# Emmerse

Emmerse allows you to virtually experience various forms of entertainment in
180-degrees. These include: concerts, sporting events, and gaming events.

This is done through the Oculus Rift VR D2 headset.

The program is written in unity to support Mac OS X and Windows platforms.

The current project goal is to feed a video file to the Oculus display.
