		<h1>The Process</h1>
		<p>Currently, our team is building small tests to try and get our idea up and running.
		We seek to entertain fans of music and sports alike with giving the atmosphere of a concert
		or the rush of being at the game. While we currently are not very far into the project,
		we have hopes to one day get this dream to be reality.
		<p>So far, as we have not gotten very far quite yet, we have developed a small "Hello World" test
		for the Rift. We are very new to developing, especially in Unity, so our team realizes that
		this will take some time.
		<p>Our next goal is to use panoramic images and convert them into the Rift to give us good hindsight
		on how to place images into the device. If possible, we will utilize a 3D camera to really give that
		"pop" that will allow people to feel almost in the picture.
